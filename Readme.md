# Backend Project – Powerful & Scalable API Service

Welcome to the **Backend Project** – a robust, secure, and scalable RESTful API built with modern Node.js technologies.

Designed to serve as the backend engine for high-performance web applications, this project can support complex platforms like YouTube with modular controllers, models, authentication, and more.

## Features

- Express.js for building fast and minimalist APIs
- MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible and scalable data modeling
- Centralized error handling and request validation
- RESTful route structure for clean API design
- JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
- Password hashing with bcrypt for secure user data
- Modular architecture: controllers, services, routes, and models
- Security enhancements with  CORS, and rate limiting
